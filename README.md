# Relational Database Design Project – Phase 2

This project is the second phase of a relational database design workflow, building on [Phase 1](https://github.com/panditpooja/data-modeling-relational-database-sql). It focuses on implementing the database schema, populating it with sample data, and writing SQL scripts to query and manipulate the data effectively.  

Developed as part of *INFO 579: SQL/NoSQL Databases for Data and Information Sciences*, this phase demonstrates hands-on SQL development, including advanced queries, stored procedures, and functions.

## 📖 Overview
In **Phase 1**, we designed a conceptual and physical data model for a business scenario. In **Phase 2**, we implemented that design and added functionality to interact with the data.  

Key steps in this phase:
- **Database Implementation**: Creating tables, defining primary and foreign keys, and inserting sample data.  
- **Single Table Queries**: Writing queries to retrieve and filter data from individual tables.  
- **Multi-table Queries**: Developing complex queries using joins, set operations, and CTEs.  
- **Routines and Logic**: Creating stored procedures, functions, and triggers for reusable database operations.
